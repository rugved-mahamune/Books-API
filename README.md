# Books-API
This project contains the Books APIs implemented with Authentication using JWT 
There are 2 services which needs running in this Repository

1. Backend

    To Run the backend the supported APIs are 
        Login
        Register
        GetBook
        GetBooks
        PostBook
        DeleteBook
        
    Traverse to the backend and run 
      npm install

      node index.js

     The APIs are exposeed at 3000 port

     The Backend also requires a MongoDB service to be up and running this can be achieved by installing mongodb on local mahcine.

2. Frontend

   To Run the frontend service run the following command

    npm install

    npm start

    This service will provide a Login/Register Page once logged in it will enable the BooksPage component.

    You can enter the Books you want to add/delete/retrieve
    The get all Books will give you the list of books present in the MongoDB


Cheers.
